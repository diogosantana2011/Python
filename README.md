# General Info

This repo contains some work I done for university and work with Python.
Though I'd keep it all nice and tidy here.

# A little funny meme to start us off!

# Technologies

A list of technologies used within the project:
* [Python 3.9.7] (https://www.python.org/): Version 3.9.7

# Python

Please bear in mind that if certain Python Modules (such as: requests, json, os, logging, datetime, pymongo etc.) are not installed on your machine, scripts will fail. 
To check current installed modules of Python, this can be done via shell/terminal, using 'pip' (command 'pip list'). 
To see currently installed version of python please use 'python --version'.

Above command will display something similar to the below:
```
Package            Version
------------------ ---------
certifi            2021.5.30
charset-normalizer 2.0.6
idna               3.2
numpy              1.21.2
pip                21.2.3
pymongo            3.12.0
requests           2.26.0
setuptools         57.4.0
urllib3            1.26.7
```

# Running-scripts

Calling python will vary from OS. On my windows I call python {script_name} and on my mac I call it via python3 {script_name}.
Best way to figure which one is to simply navigate to folder where its install (C:\Python3.9) and from here you will see application file.
Running it, will show you Pythons IDE, which you can use if you want. The IDE file path will display an .exe file, such as 'C:/python3.9/python.exe'
Therefore to start python you'd use 'python {script_name}'.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/diogosantana2011/diogosantana2011.git
$ cd ../path/to/the/file
$ python OR python3 specfile.py
```

# Collaboration

If you want to use any script to obtain extracted data from any JSON returning API; or any of the others, be my guest =D.
