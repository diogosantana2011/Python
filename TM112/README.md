### General Info
***
These are random Python files created while studying TM112 for Computing and IT. Thought I'd add and keep them all here.

### A little funny (the guy who made it mispelled 'paste' too) meme to start us off!

## Technologies
***
A list of technologies used within the project:
* [Python 3.9.7] (https://www.python.org/): Version 3.9.7

## Python
Please bear in mind that if certain Python Modules (such as: requests, json, os, logging, datetime, pymongo etc.) are not installed on your machine, scripts will fail. 
To run scripts successfully, install said modules/libraries so as to not have any of the scripts fail when actioned. Your IDE Linter should also alert you to this, be it VSCode, or even python IDE. 

To see current installed packages, open your terminal and using 'pip list' you will see currently installed packages. 
To see currently installed version of python please use 'python --version'.

Something similar to the below will display:
```
Package            Version
------------------ ---------
certifi            2021.5.30
charset-normalizer 2.0.6
idna               3.2
numpy              1.21.2
pip                21.2.3
pymongo            3.12.0
requests           2.26.0
setuptools         57.4.0
urllib3            1.26.7
```

## Running-scripts
***
Please refer to [Python](#python) above to ensure libraries required for running scripts successfully are isntalled on your machine. 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/diogosantana2011/diogosantana2011.git
$ cd ../path/to/the/file
$ python OR python3 specfile.py
```

## Running Scripts - Note

Calling python will vary from OS. On my windows I call python {script_name} and on my mac I call it via python3 {script_name}.
Best way to figure which one is to simply navigate to folder where its install (C:\Python3.9) and from here you will see application file.
Running it, will show you Pythons IDE, which you can use if you want. The IDE file path will display an .exe file, such as 'C:/python3.9/python.exe'
Therefore to start python you'd use 'python {script_name}'.
